Mastering scipy.spatial PyCon 2017 Tutorial

## Dependencies
The tutorial is designed to be executed in a single Jupyter (5.0) notebook in Python 3.x (I've been using 3.5 / 3.6 mostly) and the necessary files may be cloned from this github repo. The easiest way to identify any library dependencies you may be missing is probably to try running all cells in the notebook (`Cell` -> `Run All`) and checking if there are any issues. Nonetheless, I've tried to consolidate major import statements near the top of the notebook, and the following is a summary of the versions I've used:

| library import name | version used |
|---------------------|--------------|
| scipy | `0.19.0` |
| numpy | `1.12.1` |
| matplotlib | `2.0.0` |
| PIL | `4.1.0` |
| networkx | `1.11` |

A few other files (image files, small ad hoc Python libraries) are stored in the repo and also needed to run the full notebook.
